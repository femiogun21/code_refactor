# code_refactor
Refactoring a completed site to optimize code

## Description

I built this project in order to create a more developer friendly code by using more exact semantic.
The problems from this project solved is code that is easier to build upon and more user accessability.
I learned how important semantic can be in code and how important it is to add user accessability.
